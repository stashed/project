Goals
=====
- Customizability
- Simplicity
- RBAC (Authority, Division of Labor Ops/Dev team)


```
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-demo-repo
  namespace: demo

--------------

BackupConfig / BackupBatch (which section per Target?)

execOps:
  - alias: full
    schedule: @daily
  - alias: incremental
    schedule: */15
  - alias: restoreTask
    schedule: 0 */2

sidecar ? (per target ?)
  - execAlias: (full, incremental)
  - Fn
    - container name
    - runtime params

Restore:
  - execAlias: (restoreTest)
  - Task

--------------

BackupVerifierConfiguration

Task
- HelmInstall
- HelmUninstall

Test agianst Multiple repo?

- Always test against one repos?
- Different schedule for each repo?


BackupVerifierSession_T & BackupSession_T+1 can overlap

BackupSession


DataStored
TestBackup
Success/Fail

TestConfig -> BackupConfig/BatchBatch (per target)

jobTemplate -> RestoreTest task?



Do we need to create separate RestoreSession?
Does BackupSession has data to generate RestoreSession?
How often you want to test for restore?

RestoreTest Job
---> Launch DB etc
---> Test restored data
     ---> Summary status

---> shutdown, cleanup DB etc.
---> Update status

RBAC for this?


BluePrint does all these new things?


--------------
MariaDB

- Only take backup from mariaDB Master even if sidecar mounted in all StatefulSet pods
- Check if full backup subdir present? if not take full backup even in incremental schedule.

- Restore PITR support


Full/ Incremental backup type?
Is backup replable?

metadata index

- Reset index file when "full"(or such alias) backup is taken
- Incremental add to index file

metadata.index
=================
timestamp | alias


2 scenarios where take "full" backup even in incremental schedule:

- full backup subdir not found
- metdata.index for latest snapshot does not match the index found in temp dir.

last_snapshpot_id (not needed, always use latest snapshot for that host)
